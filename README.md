issues: 
1) after 30% BMI the calculator cannot accurately add up how many calories a person should eat, and cannot accurately calculate the amount of pounds per week they will lose
2) BMI cannot be 100% correctly calculated, so i used multiple different methods of calculations, such as bodpod, and measurement BMI and
made revisions to the old method of BMI calculation to close the gap in the margin of error when BMI is below 30% for the Height * weight method.
3) Does not have a GUI, but is simple enough of a program to build one easily.
4) It does not have any comments due to it being a simple program, if needed or wanted for me to leave comments, please email me above and i can add comments to make it easier to understand.

instructions to build: just copy and paste it into you IDE. If you want, build a GUI, its really simple for this code, it may need minor modifications to make the GUi but should still be really easy.
